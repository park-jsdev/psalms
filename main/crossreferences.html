    <a href="index.html">B.</a> Use CSS3 contextual selectors (e1, e2, e3; e f; e > f; e + f) and at least two attribute selectors, excluding class and id attribute selectors. 
    Contextual selectors and attribute selectors were used in the footer, in the navbar, and in responsive design. See "main.css".
</p>

<p>
    <a href="billing.html">C.</a> Use of CSS3 styles for color(RGBA & HSLA). Both RGBA and HSLA were used, see "forms.css".
</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html">D.</a> Use of dynamic pseudo-classes to highlight hyperlinks states of link, visited, active, hover; focus and two structural 
    pseudo-classes: first-of-type and last-of-type. Dynamic pseudo-classes were used in the navbar.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html">E.</a> Use of CSS3 background styles (background size, background-clip, background-origin, padding, margins, borders,
     use of an appropriate border style, use of rounded corners). Background styles were used in the creation of the rows.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html">G.</a> Define document content with the class and id properties and create styles for them. Class and id properties were used for many elements.
</p>

    i. Grid
    
    ii. Flex
    
    iii. Float

</p>


<p>Multimedia</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html#containerAVideo">A.</a> Use sound and video somewhere on your site. Ensure these are of short duration, preferably about 30 seconds. 
    A video was used to create a scrolling video animation background for one of the rows. It is also clickable to produce a tab containing more information.
    In production, a shorter sample of the video itself could be used for improved performance. The script was based on: 
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/2krge1/codepens_killer_html5_video_scrolling_controls_w/">Reddit thread</a> 
    and in a future version or project, I hope to produce an effect such as: <a href="https://codepen.io/markteater/pen/xbNyOJ?editors=101">Codepen link</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html#containerAVideo">B.</a> Use of transitions and animations. See above.
</p>

<p>JavaScript</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html#b2-row">A.</a> Use of variables, arithmetic, comparison and logical operators,
     subroutines, functions, arrays, conditional statements, conditional operators, and running time commands with system clock.
     JS functions were used to not only create the scrolling video effect, but to have each row expand a corresponding tab and scroll to it,
     containing more info.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

     a window alert, handled in the validateForm() function.
</p>


</p>

<p>Responsive Design</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html">A.</a> Your website design should include responsive design implementation using concepts 
    covered in this course that would accommodate desktop, tablet, and mobile designs, including positioning, grid, and flex layouts.
    The website mainly incorporates an absolute layout inside a relative layout to address responsive design. It also uses flex for
    smaller screen sizes.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html#video-wrapper">B.</a> The use of contextual selectors to control sub level menus is required, including a navicon image for mobile design.
    Contextual selectors were used to design this animation background with overlay text.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="index.html#header">C.</a> Images should also be responsive for different screen sizes and devices. The logo image and animation are responsive.
</p>
