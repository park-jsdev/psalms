        and harmonized it with a trading system based on the axiom that the market, and all events can be represented as a game of chance or a series of decisions,
         and one way to win is with a systematic approach of taking calculated risks.

  <h2>Word From Our Founder: </h2>
  <p><span style="font-size:1.2vw">George Marechal's chart was the beginning...</span> 
    When I saw the chart, which predicted the price action of the stock market precisely - 15 years into the future, I knew it was no coincidence.
     How could it be? There was a system to it. Roosevelt himself consulted Marechal, and so confident was he, that he had the chart copyrighted.
      Valuations, balance sheets, the way the wind blows on a certain day… all of these took the back seat to Marechal’s method.
       With one chart, Marechal took all the rhetoric claiming that the market could not be predicted, and the sanctimonious aphorisms the gurus 
       and so-called experts so want you to believe… and proved that is <i>BS</i>. Do you really believe that proprietary trading firms or sovereign wealth funds
        hire traders that only win 50% of their trades… or even three quarters?
      <br>
      <br>
      These methods are typically kept under lock and key, as this is a zero-sum game! Marechal himself refused to reveal his secrets for any sum of money,
       and took them to his grave. I came to the realization that conditions are symptoms, or lagging indicators of what he used to chart this forecast.
        I knew I had to learn it - to make it mine. After studying his principles, along with William Delbert Gann, Jesse Livermore, Alan H. Andrews, and many others… 
        I believe I have found the path. I also believe that their revolutionary, yet perhaps - ancient systems were incomplete, and can be improved upon.
         Join us on our journey to find the Unifying Theory and develop our event calculus model. It won’t be easy… and I guarantee nothing, but it is a worthy challenge.
          Welcome.

    <br>
    <br>
    Our trading system is fundamentally based on mathematical statistics. We understand that trading decisions made based on emotional biases are unprofitable. 
    Interestingly, people are naturally risk adverse toward gains, but risk seeking toward losses! This means that to be profitable in trading, one must go against
     their very nature… Not only that, but they must do it <i>consistently, frequently,</i> and they must do it under the emotional duress of facing the <i>unexpected</i>...
      where more often than not, split-second decisions are necessary.

      <br>

      If these two statements are true, then it must also be true that luck can be acquired with patience, conviction, and <i>preparation</i>.

      It is said that 90 percent of traders fail to make money in the stock market. This is because it is a winner-take-all, zero-sum game,
